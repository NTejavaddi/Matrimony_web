# Matrimony_web
The project described is a Django-based web application designed for a matrimonial platform, allowing users to create profiles, set partner preferences, communicate through messages, and participate in events
Below is a detailed description of the project's features and structure:
Project Overview
Purpose
The application serves as a matrimonial platform where users can sign up, create personal profiles, specify their preferences for potential partners, and interact with other users through messaging and events.
Key Features
User Registration and Authentication:
Users can register by providing a username, email, and password. The application uses Django's built-in authentication system to manage user accounts securely.
Email verification can be implemented to ensure the authenticity of user accounts.
Profile Management:
Each user has a profile that includes personal information such as bio, location, birth date, gender, religion, caste, height, education, occupation, income, and profile picture.
Users can edit their profiles after registration.
Partner Preferences:
Users can specify their preferences for potential partners including age range, height range, religion, caste, education level, occupation, and location.
Messaging System:
The application allows users to send and receive messages. Users can select senders and receivers based on their profiles.
The messaging system is designed to ensure that users can only message individuals of the opposite gender based on their preferences.
Event Management:
Users can create events with details like title, description, location, and date/time.
Other users can respond to events (accept or reject), allowing for community engagement.
Matchmaking Algorithm:
A scoring system evaluates potential matches based on user preferences and characteristics. This algorithm considers factors such as age compatibility, height preference, religion, caste, education level, occupation, and location.
WebSocket Integration for Real-Time Chat:
The application includes real-time chat functionality using Django Channels. This allows users to join chat rooms based on events or other criteria and communicate seamlessly.
Technical Stack
Django Framework: The core framework used for building the web application.
PostgreSQL Database: Used for storing user data and application state.
Django Channels: Enables WebSocket support for real-time features like chat.
Django Forms: Utilized for handling user input through forms for signup, profile creation, messaging, etc.
Custom User Model: Extends Django's default user model to include additional fields like email verification status.
Application Structure
Models:
User: Extends Django's AbstractUser to include an email field and verification status.
Profile: Stores additional user information related to personal details.
PartnerPreference: Captures user-defined criteria for potential matches.
Message: Represents messages exchanged between users.
Event: Represents events that users can create and participate in.
EventResponse: Tracks user responses to events.
Forms:
Various forms are created using Django's form system to handle user input for signup (SignupForm), profile creation (ProfileForm), partner preferences (PartnerPreferenceForm), messaging (MessageForm), and event creation (EventForm).
Views:
Handles the logic for rendering templates and processing form submissions. Includes views for signup (signup), login (login_view), profile creation (create_profile), and more.
Templates:
HTML templates are used for rendering the frontend of the application. Each view corresponds to a specific template that presents data to the user.
URLs:
URL routing is managed through Django's URL dispatcher to connect views with specific endpoints.
Security Considerations
The project implements standard security practices such as password hashing using Django's built-in mechanisms. Additional measures like CSRF protection are also included in middleware settings.
Deployment
To deploy this application on another system or server:
Set up a PostgreSQL database.
Install required packages listed in requirements.txt.
Configure environment variables (like database credentials).
Run migrations to set up the database schema.
Start the server using Django's development server or a production-ready server configuration.
This project encapsulates essential functionalities typical of matrimonial services while leveraging modern web development practices using Django.
